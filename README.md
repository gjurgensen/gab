# Discover the gift of Gab

Gab is a toy language for the purpose of learning about language design and implementations. It is a strong statically typed functional language.

The repository is separated into chapters, implementing increasingly complicated languages (known collectively as Gab). See each chapter's documentation for a description of the language and highlighted points on the implementation.

## Status

This project is still an early work in progress. Chapter documentation is lacking for the moment. Many more chapters are to come. The goal is to eventually reach a consistent and total dependently typed language (in the spirit of Coq, Agda), with an IO monad for executing real effects.

## Does Gab stand for anything?

Of course if does! It stands for "Grant's Awesome Backronym."
