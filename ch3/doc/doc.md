The explicit type annotations on function arguments is, well, annoying. For one, they are inflexible. In our untyped lambda calculus, `Î» x. x` served as the identity function on all types. But now, we are forced to give it a singular concrete type. Monomorphic frustrations aside, it is just a hassle writing all of these annotations. As I'm sure you have seen in other languages, most types can be inferred.

We will solve both problems by introducing polymorphic types, which we will restrict by unification.
